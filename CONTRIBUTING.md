# CloudSlang Contribution Guide

We welcome and encourage community contributions to CloudSlang.
Please familiarize yourself with the Contribution Guidelines and Project Roadmap before contributing.
There are many ways to help CloudSlang:
* Report issues
* Fix issues
* Improve the documentation


## Contributing Code

The best way to directly collaborate with the project contributors is through GitHub: https://github.com/CloudSlang
* If you want to contribute to our code by either fixing a problem or creating a new feature, please open a GitHub pull request.
* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect, an enhancement request or a general issue, please open a GitHub issue.


Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.
After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
When a pull request fails testing, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the failure until it passes testing and the pull request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches from maintainers).

All contributions must include acceptance of the DCO:

    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part

### Sign your work

To accept the DCO, simply add this line to each commit message with your name and email address (git commit -s will do this for you):

## Pull Requests
We encourage and support contributions from the community. No fix is too small. We strive to process all pull requests as soon as possible and with constructive feedback. If your pull request is not accepted at first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received.
To make a pull request you will need a GitHub account. For help, see GitHub's documentation on forking and pull requests. (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ )

Pull requests that fix bugs or introduce new features must include tests that test your change in addition to passing all current tests. Please do not submit pull requests if tests fail. See existing tests for examples of how to properly compose your own tests. 

Occasionally, a change will be very difficult to test. In those cases, please include a detailed note in your commit message explaining why tests are not included.


##Conduct

Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions.
Please avoid using nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
Be kind and courteous.
Those who insult, demean or harass anyone will be excluded from interaction. In particular, behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups will not be tolerated.
We welcome discussion about creating a welcoming, safe and productive environment for the community. If you have any questions, feedback or concerns please let us know. (info@cloudslang.io)
