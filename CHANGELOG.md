#CHANGE LOG

##Version 0.9.60

+ DSL Changes
	+ New or changed keywords and functions:
		+ Added `sensitive` keyword to mark inputs and outputs and system properties as sensitive. Sensitive data is not exposed in the CLI, Builder and logs.  
		+ Added `gav` keyword to indicate the Maven project group:artifact:version where the code for the `java_action` resides. Upon execution, the Maven project and all its required resources specified in its pom's `dependencies` will be resolved and downloaded (if necessary).
		+ Added `branch_result` to the `branches_context` to retrieve results from branches in a parallel step.  
		+ Added `extensions` keyword that is ignored by the compiler.
		+ Added form of `get()` function that does not take a `default` parameter.
		+ Added `check_empty(expr1, expr2)` function that returns the value of an expression if it is not empty, or the value of a second expression if the first was empty.
	+ Restructuring/Renaming - Several sections of flows, operations and system properties files have been restructured or renamed:
		+ Changed `async_loop` to `parallel_loop`.
		+ Changed `navigation` section from a map to a list.
		+ Changed `properties` section from a map to a list.
		+ Changed `overridable` to  `private` with inverted value. That is, `overridable: false` is now `private: true`.
		+ Changed operation hierarchy:
			+ Python based actions:
    		```
    		  python_action:
    		    script
    		```
			+ Java based actions:
    		```
    		  java_action:
    		    gav:
    		    class_name:
    		    method_name:
    		```
		+ Removed`aggregate` section from parallel steps. Aggregation for a `parallel_loop` is now accomplished in the `publish` section.
	+ New Validations:
		+ Flow and operation input names must be different than their output names.
		+ Step inputs and called subflow/operation output names must be different.
		+ Flow results can no longer contain expressions.
		+ Step must declare all subflow/operation inputs that are required, not private and don't have a default value.
		+ All steps must be reachable.
		+ The `on_failure` section may contain only one step.
	+ Other Changes:
		+ Changes related to `on_failure`:
			+ Support navigation to `on_failure` by using `on_failure` keyword.
			+ Navigation to `on_failure` is allowed even if no `on_failure` section exists. In such a case the flow navigates to the `FAILURE` result.
			+ An `on_failure` step cannot contain a `navigate` section. It always navigates to `FAILURE`.
		+ Context visibility was changed to make the `self` keyword unnecessary. Therefore, it has been removed from the language.
		+ Support `null` syntax in step argument list.
+ CLI / Builder Improvements
	+ Added configuration file for builder.
	+ Directory paths are displayed in error messages.
+ Terminology Changes
	+ "Tasks" are now referred to as "steps". Appropriate changes were made in the content and events.

##Version 0.9.50

+ DSL Improvements
    + Improved Documentation Style - The infile documentation of flows and operations has been changed to be more structured.
  	+ System Properties Files - System properties files now end with the .prop.sl extension and their syntax has changed.
    + System Properties Access - System properties are now accessed using the new get_sp() function.
    + Flow and Operation Names - Matching between flow and operation names against their file names is now enforced.
+ CLI Enhancements
    + Inspect - The new `inspect` command displays a file's documentation including description, inputs, outputs and results.
  	+ List - The new `list` command lists the system properties contained in a system properties file.
  	+ Default Folder - The location of the default folders for automatically importing system properties files and input files has moved to `cslang/configuration/inputs` and `cslang/configuration/properties`.
  	+ Verbosity Level - The amount of information printed to the screen by the CLI can be changed using the `--v` flag.
  	+ Configuration - A new configuration file can be found at `cslang/configuration/cslang.properties`. The file currently includes configuration for character encoding and the location of the new logging configuration file, which is found at `cslang/configuration/logging/log4j.properties` by default.
+ Compiler Changes
    + Error Handling - Executable files that are valid YAML but not valid CloudSlang, which previously failed in the pre-compilation stage, now pass pre-compilation and all errors are collected.
+ Content
    + Restructuring - The folders in the content repository have been restructured.
  	+ Additions - Content has been added in the following areas:
        + Heroku
        + Operations Orchestration
        + VMware
+ Docker Image
	  + A new CloudSlang dev image was added.

##Version 0.9

+ DSL Improvements
  	+ Simplified Value Syntax - The syntax of input and task argument default values, output values and result values has changed. We now distinguish between specifying literal values and expressions. This change alleviates the need for two sets of quotes surrounding literal strings.
  	    + Literal Values - Literals are denoted now as they are in standard YAML. For example, numbers are interpreted as numerical values and strings may be written unquoted, single quoted or double quoted.
  	    + Expressions - Expressions are preceded by a dollar sign and enclosed in curly brackets (e.g. `expression_1: ${4 + 7}`, `expression_2: ${some_input}`, `expression_3: ${get('input1', 'default_input')}`).
  	+ Task Arguments - Task arguments no longer support properties, except for an optional `default` value.
  	+ Get Function - The new get function (`get("key", "default_value")`) returns the value associated with `key` if the key is defined and its value is not `None`. If the key is undefined or its value is `None` the function returns the `default_value`. This function allows for simplifying some complex Python expressions.
  	+ Qualified Names - An operation or flow may now be referenced from a task by using the fully qualified name (e.g. `do: path.to.operation.op_name`) or a continuation of the path after an alias (e.g. `do: alias.cont.path.flow_name`).
  	+ Keyword Change - `self` replaced the former `fromInputs` keyword for referring to an input parameter as opposed to another variable with the same name in a narrower scope. Can be used in the value of an output, publish or result expression.
+ CLI Enhancements
  	+  Debug Mode - Print each taskâ€™s published variables to the screen, use the --d flag.
  	+  Log file - The execution log file is now saved under `cslang/logs/execution.log`.
  	+  Events Logging - Events logging is now more comprehensive.
+ Content Additions - Content has been added in the following areas:
  	+ OpenShift
    + Git
    + OpenStack
    + Stackato
    + HP Cloud
    + Chef
    + Google Container Engine (added in beta mode)
  	+ Amazon AWS
  	+ PowerShell
  	+ Base
    		+ Math
    		+ JSON
    		+ Remote file transfer
